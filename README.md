# Erevos

**Erevos © 2025 J. Atlas — Proprietary v1.0**  
> **Public Preview — Full release and integration options coming soon (Atlas Systems Labs, 2025).**

Erevos is a modular stability engine designed to simulate, visualise, and refine adaptive balance within complex systems.  
It operates as both a theoretical framework and a functional model, bridging system behaviour with dynamic feedback control.

---

## Overview

Erevos demonstrates the relationship between target equilibrium, environmental variation, and system response.  
Through real-time modulation of balance and noise parameters, users can observe how stability evolves under shifting conditions.

The included JavaScript demo provides a live visualisation of these dynamics, allowing immediate exploration of system behaviour.

## Features

- **Adaptive Balance Loop:** Continuous recalibration toward a target equilibrium  
- **Noise Modulation:** Adjustable external variability simulating real-world perturbations  
- **Guardrail and Pause System:** Automatic detection and correction of destabilising states  
- **Real-Time Visual Feedback:** Smooth, interactive representation of system response  
- **Statistical Monitoring:** Rolling averages and system summaries for stability assessment  

---

## Integration

Erevos is a **lightweight and modular**, proprietary stability engine written in Python, built for deployment across analytical, interactive, and control environments.

It can be:
- Embedded within simulation or modelling workflows (NumPy / SciPy compatible)  
- Exposed through API layers such as Flask or FastAPI for system integration  
- Mirrored in real-time interfaces via the included JavaScript demo logic  
- Applied as a feedback or modulation layer in adaptive or closed-loop systems  

Its architecture is fully self-contained and language-agnostic, allowing flexible implementation across diverse platforms.
